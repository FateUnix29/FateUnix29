# ***What's up!***

### You've landed on my home profile.

I'm an amateur coder in mainly Python and Rust. I'm not the best, but I have plenty of knowledge on both languages and some knowledge on a few others.<br><br>

I have an affinity for Linux, and I at least tolerate Windows 10. Windows 11 (and probably beyond) is a mess and I commonly heavily discourage Windows 11.

That being said, I use both Linux and Windows 10, sometimes at the same time, as they are two seperate computers. I created this account on the Linux machine: A Raspberry Pi Model 4B.<br>
(Now, since then, recently at the time of writing, I have upgraded to a raspi 5.)

I often distro-hop and have aspirations to create my own Linux operating system someday to resolve this issue.<br><br><br>

Complete list of knowledge *(or prior knowledge, at least)*:
- 1\. Python (Extremely well.)
- 2\. Rust (The language. Quite comfortable with it.)
- 3\. C# (Very well. recently learnt.)
- 4\. C (Okay. The main issue is finding header files and libraries and what not. Makefiles are also complicated.. ish.)
- 5\. C++ (Okay by extension (C). No idea what the class stuff is about.)
- 6\. Java (Somewhat. I know it *enough*, but I know the Microsoft flavor better.)

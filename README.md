# ***What's up!***

### You've landed on my home profile.

>I prefer to go by *'Copper'* on Github, so if you could, refer to me as that. :)

I am an amateur likes-to-think-of-himself-as-a-really-bad-one coder. I have good experience in Python,
and I can at the very least read a file into a buffer and print the buffer in C, as well as using *'man [systemcall]'* to figure out new system calls.

I have also learnt (for the most part) Rust. I have kind of neglected my skills in C so it's fuzzy.

I have extensive knowledge in what is in a processing unit, have made my own microcodes/ISA's, can code in machine code if I'm given the ISA (prefered name and if
it's documented in a way my simplistic brain can understand), and have made a bad (and currently making a good-ish) processor in Minecraft. *(Hey, it's a good simulation!)*

This is (sometimes) actually my Raspberry Pi Model 4 B. My main computer *unfortunately* runs on Windows.

Anyhow, have fun looking around. Most of my things are probably uploaded just for other specific people.

Complete list of knowledge *(or prior knowledge, at least)*:
- 1\. Python (Extremely well.)
- 2\. Rust (The language I recently considered myself to have finished learning. Quite comfortable with it, but not the best.)
- 3\. C# & Java (I can make a Java hello world, make and call functions, etc. C# is very similar to Java, so by extension, I remember a C# hello world.)
- 4\. C (Was learning. Remember basics.)
- 5\. C++ (Can make a hello world, made command line calculator once.)
- 6\. html (I can barely make a hello world.)

# ***What's up!***

### You've landed on my home profile.

##### I prefer to go by *'Copper'* on Github, so if you could, refer to me as that. :)

I'm an amateur coder in mainly Python and Rust. I'm not the best, but I have plenty of knowledge on both languages and some knowledge on a few others.<br><br>

I have an affinity for Linux, and I at least tolerate Windows 10. Windows 11 (and probably beyond) is a mess and I commonly heavily discourage Windows 11.

That being said, I use both Linux and Windows 10, sometimes at the same time, as they are two seperate computers. I created this account on the Linux machine: A Raspberry Pi Model 4B.

I often distro-hop and have aspirations to create my own Linux/GNU operating system someday to resolve this issue.<br><br><br>

Complete list of knowledge *(or prior knowledge, at least)*:
- 1\. Python (Extremely well.)
- 2\. Rust (The language I recently considered myself to have finished learning. Quite comfortable with it, but not the best.)
- 3\. C# & Java (I can make a Java hello world, make and call functions, etc. C# is very similar to Java, so by extension, I remember a C# hello world.)
- 4\. C (Was learning. Remember basics.)
- 5\. C++ (Can make a hello world, made command line calculator once.)
- 6\. html (I can barely make a hello world.)
